## MPG Data Set

The mpg data set is related to various attributes about cars.  The default usage is attempting to predict the miles-per-gallon (city or highway) based on various features of the car.  We'll attempt to predict the combined mpg, which is typically 55% city and 45% highway.  We'll just call it "mpg".

```{r intro-defn-mpg}
